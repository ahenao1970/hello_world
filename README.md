My name is Alejandro Henao, and I go by Alex. I live in Gainesville, Fla. with my wife and three children since 2002. I am originally from Panama. I am a new Analyst at the University of Florida, but have worked there in different capacities for nine years. I enjoy being with my family, basketball and reading. I look forward to this journey at BU.
